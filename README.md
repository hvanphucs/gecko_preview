## I. Introduction
I am a person who loves new things and likes to explore my own challenges. At the moment I really want to develop myself in the field of application development and data analysis.
I started learning Flutter for my next job application. This is a new framework and has a lot of development potential. I took the time to educate myself on Youtube, Web platforms and consult the UIs of the applications available on my phone.

It's fun to start right away with passions. Gecko was the first app that I really wanted to build. It is an application that helps users to easily learn English through reading news and watching videos and playing games. (From the fact that I am also studying for 4K IELTS vocabulary). The app is not available on googlePlay at the moment. And need more tweaking for the upcoming version 1.0.
